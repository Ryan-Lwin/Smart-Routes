                We have a far-reaching ambition to expand our project to an enormous extent. Our main goal is to smoothen the flow of traffic and transportation in cities. We have conceived two main solutions to traffic congestion issues. 
                One of such intervention we propose is installing Smart Traffic Lights that have similar functions as the normal lights, but in company of AI cameras, switches and detection software. 
                Another solution is promoting pedestrian detection to diminish the disturbance of pedestrian transportation and enhance municipal mobility.
